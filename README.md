An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

The analysis is comprised of the data provided in the kickstarter campaign data. 
Based on the data we're able to see the highest rate of successful campaigns have been during the month of May. We can also concur that plays have the highest rate of success.
To increase Louise's chances of a successful campaign, she should hold her campaign for a play around the month of May for about 30 days and have a goal around $3500 in the US.

### Challenge
Based on the analysis performed on the campaigns for the plays subcategory, plays with goals of under 15000 tend to be successful. 
Plays also follow the same monthly trend as the rest of the theater categories - campaings done in May tend to be successful. Another thing to note is that Plays shockingly have no cancelations.
